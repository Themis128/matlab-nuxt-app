# Model Tuning - Complete Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. RAM Prediction Model - **SUCCESSFULLY IMPROVED & IMPLEMENTED**

**Results:**

- ✅ R² improved from 0.6381 to 0.6798 (+6.5%)
- ✅ RMSE improved from 1.64 GB to 1.54 GB
- ✅ Model is now in production use

**Implementation:**

- ✅ `predict_ram.m` updated to automatically use tuned model
- ✅ Falls back to original model if tuned model unavailable
- ✅ Handles additional interaction features correctly
- ✅ Tested and working correctly

**Files:**

- `trained_models/ram_predictor_tuned.mat` - Tuned model
- `predict_ram.m` - Updated prediction function

---

### 2. Brand Classification Model - **IMPROVED VERSIONS CREATED**

**Results:**

- ⚠️ Original model (56.52%) still performs best
- ⚠️ Improved versions created but not better than original
- ✅ Per-class analysis shows some brands perform very well (Apple 100%, Realme 87.5%)

**Status:**

- Original model remains in production
- Improved models saved for future reference
- Recommendations documented for future improvements

**Files:**

- `trained_models/brand_classifier_improved.mat` - Improved model (for reference)
- `tune_brand_classification_improved.m` - Improved tuning script

## 📝 Key Files Created/Updated

### New Files:

- `PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.md` - Comprehensive performance analysis
- `TUNING_RESULTS.md` - Detailed tuning results
- `TUNING_COMPLETE.md` - This summary
- `tune_models.m` - Original tuning script
- `tune_brand_classification_improved.m` - Improved brand tuning

### Updated Files:

- `predict_ram.m` - Now uses tuned model automatically
- `trained_models/ram_predictor_tuned.mat` - Tuned RAM model
- `trained_models/brand_classifier_improved.mat` - Improved brand model

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

### For RAM Prediction:

- ✅ **Complete** - Model is improved and in use

### For Brand Classification:

1. **Data Collection:** Gather more samples, especially for minority classes
2. **Feature Engineering:** Add more features (camera, processor, OS)
3. **Alternative Methods:** Try XGBoost, Random Forest, or ensemble methods
4. **Hierarchical Approach:** Classify premium/budget first, then brand
5. **Class Reduction:** Group similar brands to reduce class count

## ✅ Verification

RAM Prediction Test:

```matlab
ram = predict_ram(4000, 6.1, 174, 2024, 999, 'Apple');
% Result: 7.0 GB ✓
```

The tuned model is working correctly and automatically handles:

- Feature engineering (interaction features)
- Model selection (tuned vs original)
- Proper normalization
