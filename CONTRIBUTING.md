## 🤝 How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. Check if the bug has already been reported in [Issues](https://github.com/Themis128/matlab-nuxt-app/issues)
2. Use the [Bug Report template](https://github.com/Themis128/matlab-nuxt-app/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)
3. Provide as much detail as possible:
   - MATLAB version
   - Operating system
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Error messages
   - Screenshots (if applicable)

### Suggesting Features

1. Check if the feature has already been suggested
2. Use the [Feature Request template](https://github.com/Themis128/matlab-nuxt-app/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)
3. Describe the use case and expected behavior

### Improving Models

1. Use the [Model Improvement template](https://github.com/Themis128/matlab-nuxt-app/issues/new?template=model_improvement.md)
2. Include performance metrics (before/after)
3. Explain the improvement approach

## 🔧 Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB R2020a or later
- Deep Learning Toolbox
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
- Node.js 18+
- Git

### Setup Steps

1. **Fork the repository**

   ```bash
   # Fork on GitHub, then clone
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/matlab-nuxt-app.git
   cd matlab-nuxt-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup MATLAB environment**

   ```matlab
   cd mobiles-dataset-docs
   run('setup_matlab_env.m')
   ```

4. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## 📝 Coding Guidelines

### MATLAB Code

- Use descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow MATLAB naming conventions:
  - Functions: `lowercase_with_underscores.m`
  - Variables: `camelCase` or `descriptive_names`
- Include function headers:
  ```matlab
  % Function Name
  % Description
  % Usage: output = function_name(input)
  ```

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Follow ESLint rules
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Add JSDoc comments for functions

### Documentation

- Update README.md if adding features
- Add examples for new functions
- Update relevant guides in `mobiles-dataset-docs/`

## 🛠 TODO Policy & CI checks

To keep the repository healthy, we aim to avoid critical TODOs (e.g., `FIXME` or `BUG`) being merged. The rules are:

- Prefer to open an issue and link it instead of leaving `FIXME` in merged code.
- If you must add a `FIXME` for immediate progress, add a reviewer, and prefer `TODO` for non-blocking remarks.
- Use `// FIXME(@owner): xyz` if tagging a specific person for follow-up.

CI and local verification:

- A GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/check-critical-todos.yml`) runs on PRs (diff scan) and on pushes to `master`/`main` (full scan) to detect `FIXME`, `BUG`, and other critical tags.
- Locally you can run:
   ```bash
   npm run check:todos        # scan full repo
   npm run check:todos:staged # scan only staged files
   npm run check:todos:pr-diff # scan files changed against origin/main
   npm run list:todos         # list all TODOs
   ```
- The pre-commit hook also runs the staged TODO scan: `npm run check:todos:staged`.

If you want to allow a `FIXME` in a PR, add a comment in the PR to explain why and link to the issue that tracks the follow-up.
